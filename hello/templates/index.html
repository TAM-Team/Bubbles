        <p>For neighbours who would like to interact with each other through different activities the Bubbles Application is a web application that allows people to plan online social events and communicate with the people nearby during social distancing. <br />
        Unlike other applications it is user friendly, the activities and chat can be limited to people nearby and all the functions are in one place.</p>
